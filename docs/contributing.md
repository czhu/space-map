## Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Please help us fix it by creating a detailed bug report.

### Before Reporting

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/czhu/space-map/issues) to avoid duplicates
- Try to reproduce the bug with the latest version
- Collect relevant information about your environment

### Creating a Bug Report

Open a [new issue](https://github.com/czhu/space-map/issues/new) and include:

**Required Information:**
- **Clear title** - Brief description of the bug
- **Description** - What happened vs. what you expected
- **Steps to reproduce** - Minimal code example that triggers the bug
- **Environment details**:
  - Space-map version: `python -c "import space_map; print(space_map.__version__)"`
  - Python version: `python --version`
  - Operating system: e.g., "Ubuntu 22.04", "macOS 13.0", "Windows 11"
  - GPU info (if relevant): `nvidia-smi` output

**Optional but Helpful:**
- Screenshots or visualizations
- Error messages and stack traces
- Sample data (if shareable)

**Example Bug Report:**

```markdown
### Bug: LDDMM fails with GPU out of memory

**Description**: When processing 10 sections with ~500K cells each, LDDMM
registration fails with CUDA out of memory error.

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Load 10 sections with 500K cells each
2. Run affine registration (succeeds)
3. Run LDDMM with `mgr.ldm_pair(...)` (fails)

**Environment**:
- Space-map: 0.1.0
- Python: 3.9.7
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM)

**Error message**:
```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.5 GiB...
```
```

## Suggesting Features

Have an idea to improve Space-map? We'd love to hear it!

### Before Suggesting

- Check if the feature already exists in the latest version
- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/czhu/space-map/issues) for similar suggestions
- Consider if the feature fits Space-map's scope (3D tissue reconstruction)

### Creating a Feature Request

Open a [new issue](https://github.com/czhu/space-map/issues/new) with:

- **Clear title** - Brief feature description
- **Problem statement** - What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed solution** - How should it work?
- **Use cases** - Who would benefit and how?
- **Alternatives** - Other approaches you've considered

**Example Feature Request:**

```markdown
### Feature: Support for multi-channel image alignment

**Problem**: Currently Space-map only uses cell coordinates. I have
histology images for each section that could improve alignment.

**Proposed solution**: Add option to provide images alongside coordinates:
```python
flowImport.init_with_images(xys, images, ids=layer_ids)
```

**Use cases**: Researchers with H&E or immunofluorescence images of
sections could achieve better registration accuracy.

**Alternatives**: Manual pre-alignment of images before using Space-map.
```
